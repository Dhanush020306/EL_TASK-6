# Cryptography Fundamentals (Task 6)

## Project Overview
This repository contains my practical implementation of cryptographic concepts using **CyberChef**. The goal was to understand data protection, integrity, and authenticity.

## Tasks Completed
* **File Encryption:** Encrypted plaintext using AES-256-CBC.
* **Key Management:** Generated a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair.
* **Integrity Testing:** Verified file integrity using SHA-256 hashing.
* **Digital Identity:** Created a digital signature using RSA Signing.

## Tools Used
* CyberChef (GCHQ)

## Files Included
* `Report.pdf`: Comprehensive experiment findings.
* `Screenshots/`: Visual evidence of the encryption and hashing processes.
